<H3>What is Periodic Calendar?</H3>
Periodic Calendar is a GUI utility which can be used to:
<ul>
	<li>track women menstrual cycles</li>
	<li>predict the fertile days when the probability to get pregnant is high</li>
	<li>predict the "safe" days when the probability to get pregnant is minimal</li>
	<li>predict the day of the next menstruations</li>
	<li>record the pregnancy</li>
	<li>calculate the pregnancy weeks</li>
	<li>predict the baby's birth date</li>
	<li>record the personal notes for any day</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point the fertility prediction is based on the calendar method only
which is not very precise. It is not recommended to use this method alone
for the natural family planing.</p>

<p>In the future versions it is planned to add the support for the BBT (Basal
Body Temperature) method which in addition to the calendar method provides
more precise predictions. However, this method requires more efforts (daily
temperature measurements) while the calendar method requires only to remember
the cycle start dates and enter them somehow into the program. The effectiveness
of the BBT method itself is about 80-90%. Combining more than one method makes
the predictions more effective.</p>

<p>Other self-observations methods I know are really hard to support on a computer.</p>

<p>THIS PROGRAM PREDICTIONS IN NO CASES CAN BE USED AS THE FINAL. THE METHODS USED
ARE REALLY FAR FROM BEING 100% RELIABLE.</p>
