Periodic Calendar is a GUI application which assists in women menstrual cycles
tracking and fertility periods prediction. This information can be used as 
supportive either for conception or contraception planning.

At this point the fertility prediction is based only on the calendar method
which is not very precise. It is not recommended to use this method alone
for the contraception.

In the future versions it is planned to add support for the BBT (Basal
Body Temperature) method which in addition to the calendar method provides 
more precise predictions. However, this method requires more efforts (daily
temperature measurements) while the calendar method requires only to remember
the cycle start dates and enter them somehow into the program. The effectiveness
of the BBT method itself is about 80-90%. Combining more than one method makes 
the predictions more effective.

Other self-observations methods I know are really hard to support on a computer.

THIS PROGRAM PREDICTIONS IN NO CASES CAN BE USED AS THE FINAL. THE METHODS USED
ARE REALLY FAR FROM BEING 100% RELIABLE.

Please see the application online help for more information.


PERIODIC CALENDAR 1.x DATA MIGRATION NOTES

Versions 2.x and 3.x of the Periodic Calendar use new file format which is based on XML. 
If you would like to import the data you maintained in the previous version, 
please use the Import/Export feature located in the File submenu of the main menu.

Version 3.x of the data file is backward compatible with 2.x which means you can open

is not guaranteed.
