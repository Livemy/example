    This Java SMS Client aims to support the communication between a computer<br>
    and a
    mobile device via a serial connection. This serial connection can either be a<br>
    serial cable or a infrared connection (IRDA with virtual COM port).&nbsp;Serial
    drivers<br>
    for
    Windows are included in this package as well as an installation guide.<br>
    <br>
    The tool allows sending, reading and writing of SMS in both transmit and<br>
    received format, as well as the sending of ordinary AT commands to the mobile.&nbsp;<br>
    The
    tool
    is using the PDU SMS format which is supported by most GSM mobiles.<br>
