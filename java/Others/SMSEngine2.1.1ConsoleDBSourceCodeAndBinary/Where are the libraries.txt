Note : 

To reduce the size of the zip file, i have deleted the lib folder from the root, 
but you can copy back from dist folder.

While you are changing the app(development), please remember to locate dll file under %jdk/bin% 
Please remember to add the libraries, which are located under dist\lib to buildpath

For any further questions, you can contact with me.

Regards
