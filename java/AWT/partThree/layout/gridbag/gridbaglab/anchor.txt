anchor


The GridBagConstraints.anchor variable specifies where a component is anchored in its display area.  It's 
important to note that setting the anchor constraint may seemingly have no effect if the component's fill 
constraint is set to anything other than GridBagConstraints.NONE, due to the fact that the component will 
expand to fill a portion of its display area.

Although the anchor constraint is relative to a component's display area, it does not affect the display area 
itself — only the placement of the component within the display area is affected.
