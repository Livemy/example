weightx and weighty


If a container is larger than the combined preferred sizes of its components, then a component's weightx and 
weighty constraints determine how much of the extra space a component's display area consumes. The weightx and 
weighty constraints apply strictly to the component's display area, and not the component itself, although 
components can be coaxed into filling their display areas in a number of different ways by setting the fill 
constraint.

GridBagConstraints.weightx and GridBagConstraints.weighty are the only constraints that are specified as double 
values. Additionally, both weightx and weighty must be positive. Typically, weightx and weighty are specified as 
a number between 0.0 and 1.0, although numbers greater than 1.0 may be specified. 

A component's weighting affects not only how much extra space the component's display area is given, but also 
potentially affects the display areas of components residing in the same row and the same column.
