ipadx and ipady


Whereas the insets constraint specifies an external padding between the edges of a component and its display area, 
ipadx and ipady specify an internal padding applied to the component (not the display area).  The rarely used ipadx 
and ipady constraints result in a component's preferred and minimum sizes increasing (for positive values) and 
decreasing (for negative values).
