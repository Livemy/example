gridx and gridy


The gridx and gridy constraints specify the upper left-hand grid cell of a component's display area. Grid cell 
locations are zero-based, and therefore a grid cell in the upper left-hand corner of a container always has a 
(gridx,gridy) of (0,0). 

In addition to specifying a numerical grid position, both gridx and gridy may be assigned GridBagConstraints.RELATIVE.
A RELATIVE setting for gridx means that the component will be placed to the right of the last component added to the 
container. A RELATIVE setting for gridy means that the component will be placed in the row below the last component 
added to the container.
