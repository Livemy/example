gridwidth and gridheight


The gridwidth and gridheight constraints determine the size of a component's display area, not necessarily the 
size of the component itself. 

In addition to integer values for gridwidth and gridheight, the values 
GridBagConstraints.RELATIVE and GridBagConstraints.REMAINDER may also be specified. RELATIVE means that the 
component will be the next to last component in its row (for gridwidth) or the next to last component in its 
column (for gridheight). A value of REMAINDER results in the component being the last component in its row 
(gridwidth) or column (gridheight). Specifying REMAINDER will cause the component's display area to expand in 
order to span as many grid cells as required to be the last component in its respective row or column.
