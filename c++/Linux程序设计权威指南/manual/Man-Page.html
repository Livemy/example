<P>This HOWTO explains what you should bear in mind when you are going
to write on-line documentation -- a so called man page -- that you want
to make accessible via the man(1) command. Throughout this HOWTO, a manual
entry is simply referred to as a man page, regardless of actual length
and without sexist intention. </P>

<P><A NAME="q0"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>0) A few thoughts on documentation</FONT></B>
</P>

<P>Why do we write documentation? Silly question. Because we want others
to be able to use our program, library function or whatever we have written
and made available. But writing documentation is not all there is to it:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Documentation must be accessible. If it's hidden in some non-standard
place where the documentation related tools won't find it -- how can it
serve its purpose? </LI>

<LI>documentation must be reliable and accurate. There's nothing more annoying
than having program behaviour and documentation disagree. Users will curse
you, send you hate mail and throw your work into the bit bucket, with the
firm intent to never install anything written by that jerk again. </LI>
</UL>

<P>The historical and well known way documentation is accessed on UNIX
is via the man(1) command. This HOWTO describes what you have to do to
write a man page that will be correctly processed by the documentation
related tools. The most important of these tools are man(1), xman(1x),
apropos(1), makewhatis(8) and catman(8). Reliability and accuracy of the
information are, of course, up to you. But even in this respect you will
find <A HREF="#q8">some ideas below</A> that help you avoid some common
glitches. </P>

<P><A NAME="q1"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>1) How are man pages accessed? </FONT></B></P>

<P>You need to know the precise mechanism how man pages are accessed in
order to give your man page the right name and install it in the right
place. Any man page belongs to a specific section, which is denoted by
a single character. The most common sections under Linux and their human
readable names are </P>

<PRE>Section The human readable name
   1    User commands that may be started by everyone.
   2    System calls, that is, functions provided by the kernel.
   3    Subroutines, that is, library functions.
   4    Devices, that is, special files in the /dev directory.
   5    File format descriptions, e.g. /etc/passwd.
   6    Games, self-explanatory.
   7    Miscellaneous, e.g. macro packages, conventions.
   8    System administration tools that only root can execute.
   9    Another (Linux specific) place for kernel routine documentation.
   n    New documentation, that may be moved to a more appropriate section.
   o    Old documentation, that may be kept for a grace period.
   l    Local documentation referring to this particular system.
</PRE>

<P>The name of the source file for a man page (the input to the formatting
system) is the name of the command, function or file name, followed by
a dot, followed by the section. If you write the documentation on the format
of the `passwd' file you have to name the source file `passwd.5'. Here
we also have an example of a file name that is the same as a command name.
There might be even a library subroutine named passwd. Sectioning is the
usual way to resolve these ambiguities: The command description is found
in the file `passwd.1' and the hypothetical library subroutine in `passwd.3'.
</P>

<UL>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Sometimes additional characters are appended and the file
name looks for example like `xterm.1x' or `wish.1tk'. The intent is to
indicate that this is documentation for an X Window program or a Tk application,
respectively. Some manual browsers can make use of this additional information.
For example xman will use `xterm(x)' and `wish(tk)' in the list of available
documentation. </FONT></P>
</UL>

<P>Please don't use the n, o and l sections; according to the File System
Standard these sections are deprecated. Stick to the numeric sections.
Beware of name clashes with existing programs, functions or file names.
It is certainly a bad idea to write yet another editor and call it ed,
sed (for smart ed) or red (for Rocky's ed). By making sure your program's
name is unique you avoid that someone executes your program and reads someone
else's man page or vice versa. Checking out the lsm database on a program
name is a place to start doing so. </P>

<P>Now we know the name to give our file. The next decision is which directory
it will finally get installed (say, when the user runs `make install' for
your package.) On Linux, all man pages are below directories mentioned
in the environment variable MANPATH. The doc related tools use it quite
similar like the shell uses PATH to locate executables. In fact, MANPATH
has the same format as PATH. Both hold a colon separated list of directories
(with the exception that MANPATH does not allow empty fields and relative
pathnames but has absolute names only.) If MANPATH is not set or not exported,
a default will be used that contains at least the /usr/man directory. To
speed up the search and to keep directories small, the directories specified
by MANPATH (the so called base directories) contain a bunch of subdirectories
named `man&lt;s&gt;' where &lt;s&gt; stands for the one character section
introduced in the table above. Not all of the sections may be represented
by a subdirectory because there simply is no reason to keep an empty `mano'
subdirectory. However, there may be directories named `cat&lt;s&gt;', `dvi&lt;s&gt;'
and `ps&lt;s&gt;' which hold documentation that is ready to display or
print. More on this later. The only other file in any base directory should
be a file named `whatis'. The purpose and creation of this file will also
be described under paragraph 11). The safest way to have a man page for
section &lt;s&gt; installed in the right place is to put it in the directory
/usr/man/man&lt;s&gt;. A good Makefile, however, will allow the user to
chose a base directory, by means of a make variable, MANDIR, say. Most
of the GNU packages can be configured with the --prefix=/what/ever option.
The manuals will then be installed under the base directory /what/ever/man.
I suggest you also provide a way to do something similar. </P>

<P>With the advent of the <A HREF="ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/docs/linux-standards/fsstnd/">Linux
File System Standard</A> (FS-Stnd), things became more complicated. The
FS-Stnd 1.2 states that </P>

<UL>
<P>&quot;Provisions must be made in the structure of /usr/man to support
manual pages which are written in different (or multiple) languages.&quot;
</P>
</UL>

<P>This is achieved by introducing another directory level that distinguishes
between different languages. Quoting again from FS-Stnd 1.2: </P>

<UL>
<P>&quot;This naming of language subdirectories of /usr/man is based on
Appendix E of the POSIX 1003.1 standard which describes the locale identification
string -- the most well accepted method to describe a cultural environment.
The &lt;locale&gt; string is: &lt;language&gt;[_&lt;territory&gt;][.&lt;character-set&gt;][,&lt;version&gt;]&quot;</P>
</UL>

<P>(See the FS-Stnd for a few common &lt;locale&gt; strings.) According
to these guidelines, we have our man pages in /usr/man/&lt;locale&gt;/man[1-9lno].
The formatted versions should then be in /usr/man/&lt;locale&gt;/cat[1-9lno]
of course, otherwise we could only provide them for a single locale. HOWEVER,
I can not recommend switching to that structure at this time. The FS-Stnd
1.2 also allows that </P>

<UL>
<P>&quot;Systems which use a unique language and code set for all manual
pages may omit the &lt;locale&gt; substring and store all manual pages
in &lt;mandir&gt;. For example, systems which only have English manual
pages coded with ASCII, may store manual pages (the man[1-9] directories)
directly in /usr/man. (That is the traditional circumstance and arrangement
in fact.)&quot; </P>
</UL>

<P>I would not switch until all tools (like xman, tkman, info and many
others that read man pages) can cope with the new structure. </P>

look like?</FONT></B> </P>

<P>Let me present you an example. Below I will explain it in detail. If

<B>NAME
</B>     foo - frobnicate the bar library

<B>SYNOPSIS
</B>     <B>foo [-bar] [-c</B> <I>config-file</I> <B>]</B> <I>file</I> <B>...

DESCRIPTION
</B>     <B>foo</B>  frobnicates the bar library by tweaking internal symbol
     tables. By default it parses all baz segments and rearranges
     them  in  reverse  order  by time for the <B>xyzzy</B>(1) linker to
     find them. The symdef entry is then compressed using the WBG
     (Whiz-Bang-Gizmo) algorithm.  All files are processed in the
     order specified.

<B>OPTIONS
</B>     -b   Do not write `busy' to stdout while processing.

     -c config-file
          Use the alternate system wide  <I>config-file</I>  instead  of
          <I>/etc/foo.conf</I>.   This overrides any <B>FOOCONF</B> environment
          variable.

     -a   In addition to the baz segments, also parse the  blurfl
          headers.

     -r   Recursive  mode.  Operates  as fast as lightning at the
          expense of a megabyte of virtual memory.

<B>FILES
</B>     <I>/etc/foo.conf
</I>          The system wide configuration file. See <B>foo</B>(5) for fur-
          ther details.
     <I>~/.foorc
</I>          Per  user  configuration  file.  See <B>foo</B>(5) for further
          details.

<B>ENVIRONMENT
</B>     FOOCONF
          If non-null the full pathname for an  alternate  system
          wide <I>foo.conf</I>.  Overridden by the -c option.

<B>DIAGNOSTICS
</B>     The following diagnostics may be issued on stderr:

     Bad magic number.
          The input file does not look like an archive file.
     Old style baz segments.
          foo  can  only  handle  new  style  baz segments. COBOL
          object libraries are not supported in this version.

<B>BUGS
</B>     The command name should have been chosen more  carefully  to
     reflect its purpose.

</PRE>

<P>Here's the explanation as I promised. </P>

<P><B>The NAME section</B></P>

<P>...is the only required section. Man pages without a name section are
as useful as refrigerators at the north pole. This section also has a standardized
format consisting of a comma separated list of program or function names
followed by a dash followed by a short (usually one line) description what
functionality the program (function, file) is supposed to provide. By means
of makewhatis(8) the name sections make it into the whatis database files.
Makewhatis is the reason why the name section must exist and why it must
adhere to the format I described. In the groff source it must look like</P>

<P>.SH NAME foo \- frobnicate the bar library </P>

<P>The \- is of importance here. The backslash is needed to make the dash
distinct from a hyphenation dash that may appear in either the command
name or the one line description. </P>

<P><B>The SYNOPSIS section</B> </P>

<P>...is intended to give a short overview on available program options.
For functions this sections lists corresponding include files and the prototype
so the programmer knows the type and number of arguments as well as the
return type. </P>

<P><B>The DESCRIPTION section </B></P>

<P>...gives an eloquent explanation why your sequence of 0s and 1s is worth
anything at all. Here's where you write down all your knowledge. This is
the Hall Of Fame. Win other programmer's and user's admiration by making
this section the source of reliable and detailed information. Explain what
the arguments are for, the file format, what algorithms do the dirty jobs.
</P>

<P><B>The OPTIONS section</B></P>

<P>...gives a description for any option how it affects program behaviour.
You knew that, didn't you? </P>

<P><B>The FILES section</B></P>

<P>...lists files the program or function uses. For example, configuration
files, startup files, files the program directly operates on. It is a good
idea to give the full pathname of these files and to make the install process
modify the directory part to match user preferences: the groff manuals
have a default prefix of /usr/local, so they reference /usr/local/lib/groff/*
by default. However, if you install using 'make prefix=/opt/gnu' the references
in the man page change to /opt/gnu/lib/groff/* </P>

<P><B>The ENVIRONMENT section </B></P>

<P>...lists all environment variables that affect your program or function
and tells how, of course. Most commonly the variables will hold pathnames,
filenames or default options. </P>

<P><B>The DIAGNOSTICS section</B> </P>

<P>...should give an overview of the most common error messages from your
program and how to cope with them. There's no need to explain system error
error messages (from perror(3)) or fatal signals (from psignal(3)) as they
can appear during execution of any program. </P>

<P><B>The BUGS section </B></P>

<P>...should ideally be non-existent. If you're brave, you can describe
here limitations, known inconveniences, features that others may regard
as misfeatures. If you're not so brave, rename it the TO DO section ;-)
</P>

<P><B>The AUTHOR section</B></P>

<P>...is nice to have in case there are gross errors in the documentation
or program behaviour (Bzzt!) and you want to mail a bug report. </P>

<P><B>The SEE ALSO section</B> </P>

<P>...is a list of related man pages in alphabetical order. Conventionally,
it is the last section. You are free to invent other sections if they really
don't fit in one of those described so far. So how exactly did you generate
that man page? I expected that question, here's the source, Luke:</P>

<P><A NAME="q3"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>3) How do I document several programs/functions
in a single man page?</FONT></B></P>

<P>Many programs (grep, egrep) and functions (printf, fprintf, ...) are
documented in a single man page. However, these man pages would be quite
useless if they were only accessible under one name. We can not expect
a user to remember that the egrep man page is actually the grep man page.
It is therefore necessary to have the man page available under different
names. You have several possibilities to achieve this: </P>

<OL>
<LI>have identical copies for each name. </LI>

<LI>connect all man pages using hard links. </LI>

<LI>symbolic links pointing to the actual man page. </LI>

<LI>use groff's `source' mechanism provided by the `.so' macro. </LI>
</OL>

<P>The first way is obviously a waste of disk space. The second is not
recommended because intelligent versions of the catman program can save
a lot of work by looking at the the file type or contents. Hard links will
prevent catman from being clever. (catman's purpose is to format all man
pages so that they can be displayed more quickly.) The third alternative
has a slight drawback: if flexibility is a concern, you have to be aware
that there are file systems that do not support symbolic links. The upshot
of this is that the Best Thing (TM) is using groff's source mechanism.
Here's how to do it: If you want to have your man page available under
the names `foo' and `bar' in section 1, then put the man page in foo.1
and have bar.1 look like this: </P>

<P>.so man1/foo.1</P>

<P>It is important to specify the `man1/' directory part as well as the
file name `foo.1' because when groff is run by the browser it will have
the manual base directory as its current working directory (cwd) and groff
interprets .so arguments relative to the cwd. </P>

<P><A NAME="q4"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>4) Which macro package should I use?
</FONT></B></P>

<P>There are a number of macro packages especially designed for use in
writing man pages. Usually they are in the groff macro directory /usr/lib/groff/tmac.
The file names are <TT>tmac.</TT>&lt;something&gt;, where &lt;something&gt;
is the argument to groff's -m option. Groff will use <TT>tmac.</TT>&lt;something&gt;
when it is given the `<TT>-m</TT> &lt;something&gt;' option. Often the
blank between `<TT>-m</TT>' and `&lt;something&gt;' is omitted so we may
say `<TT>groff -man</TT>' when we are formatting man pages using the <TT>tmac.an
</TT>macro package. That's the reason for the strange name `tmac.an'. Besides
tmac.an there is another popular macro package, <TT>tmac.doc</TT>, which
originated at the University of California at Berkeley. Many BSD man pages
use it and it seems that UCB has made it its standard for documentation.
The <TT>tmac.doc</TT> macros are much more flexible but alas, there are
manual browsers that will not use them but always call <TT>groff -man</TT>.
For example, all <TT>xman</TT> programs I have seen will screw up on man
pages requiring <TT>tmac.doc</TT>. So do yourself a favor: use <TT>tmac.an</TT>
-- use of any other macro package is considered harmful. <TT>tmac.andoc
</TT>is a pseudo macro package that takes a look at the source and then
loads either <TT>tmac.an</TT> or <TT>tmac.doc</TT>. Actually any man page
browser should use it but until now not all of them do, so it is best we
cling to ye olde <TT>tmac.an</TT>. Anything I tell you from now on and
concerning macros only holds true for <TT>tmac.an</TT>. If you want to
use the <TT>tmac.doc</TT> macros anyway, here is a pointer to detailed
information on how to use them: <A HREF="http://www.bsdi.com/bsdi-man">http://www.bsdi.com/bsdi-man</A>
There is a searchable index form on the page. Enter <TT>mdoc.samples</TT>
and it will find you <TT>mdoc.samples(7)</TT>, a tutorial sampler for writing
BSD man pages. </P>

The definitive dope for troff, with all macros explained, is
the <A HREF="ftp://ftp.uni-trier.de/pub/books/obi/Bell.Labs/cstr/54.gz">
    <I>Troff User's Manual</I></A>
by Jospeh F. Ossanna and Brian W. Kernighan, revised November 1992.
AT&T Bell Labs have made it publicly available. It's a 92k gzipped
PostScript file.
Don't forget to check out
<A HREF="http://www.kohala.com/~rstevens/">W. Richard Steven's
homepage</A> (famous for <I>Unix Network Programming</I> as well as
the <I>TCP/IP Illustrated</I> trilogy),
who also has a list of
<A HREF="http://www.kohala.com/~rstevens/troff/troff.html">Troff Resources</A>
including tbl, eqn, pic and other filters.

<P><A NAME="q5"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>5) What preprocessors may I use? </FONT></B></P>

<P>Groff comes with at least three preprocessors, tbl, eqn, and pic (on
some systems they are named gtbl, geqn and gpic.) Their purpose is to translate
preprocessor macros and their data to regular troff input. Tbl is a table
preprocessor, eqn is an equations/maths preprocessor and pic is a picture
preprocessor. Please refer to the man pages for more information on what
functionality they provide. To put it in a nutshell: don't write man pages
requiring ANY preprocessor. Eqn will generally produce terrible output
for typewriter-like devices, unfortunately the type of device 99% of all
man pages are viewed on. For example, XAllocColor.3x uses a few formulas
with exponentiation. Due to the nature of typewriter-like devices the exponent
will be on the same line as the base. N to the power of two appears as
`N2'. Tbl should be avoided because all xman programs I have seen fail
on them. Xman 3.1.6 uses the following command to format man pages, e.g.
signal(7): </P>

<P><TT>gtbl /usr/man/man7/signal.7 | geqn | gtbl | groff -Tascii -man /tmp/xmana01760
2&gt; /dev/null</TT> </P>

<P>which screws up for sources using gtbl, because gtbl output is fed again
into gtbl. The effect is a man page without your table. I don't know if
it's a bug or a feature that gtbl chokes on its own output or if xman could
be a little smarter not using gtbl twice... Anyway, if you want a table,
format it yourself and put it between .nf .fi lines so that it will be
left unformatted. You won't have bold and italics this way but this beats
having your table swallowed any day. I have yet to see a man page requiring
pic preprocessing. But I would not like it. As you can see above, xman
will not use it and groff will certainly do the funky wadakiki on the input.
</P>

<P>IMHO it is best to distribute source only. The argument that it's inaccessible
on systems without groff does not matter. The 500+ man pages of the Linux
Documentation Project are source only. The man pages of XFree86 are source
only. The man pages from the FSF are source only. In fact, I have rarely
seen software distributed with formatted man pages. If any sysadmin is
really concerned about having man pages accessible then he also has groff
installed. </P>

<P><A NAME="q7"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>7) What are the font conventions?
</FONT></B></P>

<P>First of all: don't use direct font operators like \fB \fP etc. Use
macros which take arguments. This way you avoid a common glitch: forgetting
the font change at the end of the word and having the bold or italic extend
up to the next font change. Believe me, it happens more often than you
think. The <TT>tmac.an</TT> macros provide the following type faces: </P>

<UL>
<P>.B Bold </P>

<P>.BI Bold alternating with italics </P>

<P>.BR Bold alternating with Roman </P>

<P>.I Italics </P>

<P>.IB Italics alternating with bold </P>

<P>.IR Italics alternating with Roman </P>

<P>.RB Roman alternating with bold</P>

<P>.RI Roman alternating with italics </P>

<P>.SM Small (scaled 9/10 of the regular size)</P>

<P>.SB Small bold (NOT small alternating with bold) </P>
</UL>

<P>X alternating with Y means that the odd arguments are typeset in X while
the even arguments are typeset in Y. For example </P>

<UL>
<P>.BI &quot;Arg 1 is Bold, &quot; &quot;Arg 2 is Italics, &quot; &quot;and
Bold, &quot; &quot;and Italics.&quot; </P>
</UL>

<P>The double quotes are needed to include white space into an argument.
So much for what's available. Here's how you should make use of the different
typefaces: (portions shamelessly stolen from man(7)) </P>

<P>Although there are many arbitrary conventions for man pages in the UNIX
world, the existence of several hundred Linux-specific man pages defines
our standards: For functions, the arguments are always specified using
italics, even in the SYNOPSIS section, where the rest of the function is
specified in bold: </P>

<UL>
<P>.BI &quot;myfunction(int &quot; argc &quot;, char **&quot; argv ); </P>
</UL>

<P>Filenames are always in italics, except in the SYNOPSIS section, where
included files are in bold. So you should use </P>

<UL>
<P>.I /usr/include/stdio.h </P>
</UL>

<P>and </P>

<UL>
<P>.B #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; </P>
</UL>

<P>Special macros, which are usually in upper case, are in bold: </P>

<UL>
<P>.B MAXINT </P>
</UL>

<P>When enumerating a list of error codes, the codes are in bold. This
list usually uses the .TP (paragraph with hanging tag) macro as follows:
</P>

<UL>
<P>.TP<BR>
.B EBADF<BR>
.I fd is not a valid file descriptor.<BR>
.TP <BR>
.B EINVAL <BR>
.I fd is unsuitable for reading <BR>
</P>
</UL>

<P>Any reference to another man page (or to the subject of the current
man page) is in bold. If the manual section number is given, it is given
in roman, without any spaces: </P>

<UL>
<P>.BR man (7)</P>
</UL>

<P>Acronyms look best when typeset in small type face. So I recommend </P>

<UL>
<P>.SM UNIX </P>

<P>.SM ASCII</P>

<P>.SM TAB </P>

<P>.SM NFS</P>

<P>.SM LALR(1)</P>
</UL>

<P><A NAME="q8"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>8) Polishing your man page</FONT></B>
</P>

<P>Following are some guidelines that increase reliability, readability
and 'formatability' of your documentation.</P>

<UL>
<LI>Test examples if they work (use cut and paste to give your shell the
exact wording from the man page) read output of your command into your
man page, don't type what you THINK your program will print. </LI>

<LI>Proof read, ispell, have someone else read it, especially if you are
not a native English speaker. The HOWTO you are reading by now has not
yet passed the latter test. Do you want to volunteer? </LI>

<LI>Test your man page: Does groff complain when you format your man page?
It's nice to have the groff command line in a comment. Does the man(1)
command complain when you call `man yourprog'? Does the way how man(1)
uses the formatting system produce the expected result? Will xman(1x) and
tkman(1tk) cope with your manual? XFree86 3.1 has xman 3.1.6 - X11R6, it
will try to uncompress using <BR>
<TT>gzip -c -d &lt; %s &gt; %s <BR>
zcat &lt; %s &gt; %s </TT></LI>

<LI>Will makewhatis(8) be able to extract the one-line description from
the NAME section? </LI>
</UL>

<P><A NAME="q9"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>9) How do I get a plain text man page
without all that ^H^_ stuff? </FONT></B></P>

<P>Have a look at <TT>col</TT>(1), <TT>col </TT>can filter out backspace
sequences. Just in case you can't wait that long: </P>

<P><TT>funnyprompt$ groff -t -e -mandoc -Tascii manpage.1 | col -bx &gt;
manpage.txt</TT> </P>

<P>The -t and -e switches tell groff to preprocess using tbl and eqn. This
is overkill for man pages that don't require preprocessing but it doesn't
harm apart from a few CPU cycles wasted. On the other hand, not using -t
when it is actually required does harm: the table is terribly formatted.
You can even find out (well, &quot;guess&quot; is a better word) what command
is needed to format a certain groff document (not just man pages) by issuing
</P>

<P><TT>funnyprompt$ grog /usr/man/man7/signal.7 groff -t -man /usr/man/man7/signal.7
</TT></P>

<P>&quot;Grog&quot; stands for &quot;GROff Guess&quot;, and it does what
it says--guess, if it were perfect we wouldn't need options any more. I've
seen it guess wrong on macro packages, but never on preprocessors. Here
is a little perl script I wrote that can delete the page headers and footers,
therefore saving you a few pages when printing long and elaborate man pages.
Save it in a file named strip-headers &amp; chmod 755. </P>

<PRE>    #!/usr/bin/perl -wn
    #  make it slurp the whole file at once:
    undef $/;
    #  delete first header:
    s/^\n*.*\n+//;
    #  delete last footer:
    s/\n+.*\n+$/\n/g;
    #  delete page breaks:
    s/\n\n+[^ \t].*\n\n+(\S+).*\1\n\n+/\n/g;
    #  collapse two or more blank lines into a single one:
    s/\n{3,}/\n\n/g;
    #  see what's left...
    print;
</PRE>

<P>You have to use it as the first filter after the 'man' command as it
relies on the number of newlines being output by groff. For example: </P>

<P><TT>funnyprompt$ man bash | strip-headers | col -bx &gt; bash.txt</TT>
</P>

<P><A NAME="q10"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>10) How do I get a high quality PostScript
man page? </FONT></B></P>

<P><TT>funnyprompt$ groff -t -e -mandoc -Tps manpage.1 &gt; manpage.ps</TT>
</P>

<P>Print that using your favorite PostScript printer/interpreter. See <A HREF="#q9">question
9)</A> for explanation of options. </P>

<P><A NAME="q11"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>11) How do I get `apropos' and `whatis'
to work? </FONT></B></P>

<P>Suppose you wonder what compilers are installed on your system and how
these can be invoked. To answer this (frequently asked) question you say
</P>

<P><TT>funnyprompt$ apropos compiler<BR>
</TT>f77 (1) - Fortran 77 compiler <BR>
gcc (1) - GNU C and C++ compiler<BR>
pc (1) - Pascal compiler</P>

<P>Apropos and whatis are used to give a quick response which man page
has information on a certain topic. Both programs search a number of files
named `whatis' that may be found in each of the manual base directories.
Like I said before, the whatis data base files contain a one line entry
for any man page in the respective directory tree. In fact, that line is
exactly the NAME section (to be precise: joined on one line and with hyphenation
removed, also note that the section is mentioned within parentheses). The
whatis data base files are created with the makewhatis(8) program. There
are several versions around, so please refer to the man page what options
are available. In order for makewhatis to be able to extract the NAME sections
correctly it is important that you, the manual writer, adhere to the NAME
section format described under <A HREF="#q2">question 2)</A>. The difference
between apropos and whatis is where in the line and what they are looking
for. Apropos (which is equivalent to <TT>man -k</TT>) searches the argument
string anywhere on the line whereas whatis (equivalent to <TT>man -f</TT>)
tries to match a complete command name only on the part before the dash.
Consequently, `<TT>whatis cc</TT>' will report if there is a cc manual
and remain quiet for gcc. </P>
