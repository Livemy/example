  *
  * The KdevDoc class provides a document object that can be used in conjunction with the classes
  * KdevApp and KdevView to create a document-view model for MDI (Multiple Document Interface)
  * Qt 2.1 applications based on QApplication and QMainWindow as main classes and QWorkspace as MDI manager widget.
  * Thereby, the document object is created by the KdevApp instance (and kept in a document list) and contains
  * the document structure with the according methods for manipulating the document
  * data by KdevView objects. Also, KdevDoc contains the methods for serialization of the document data
  * from and to files.
