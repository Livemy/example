This theme marble3D was created by Mark J Eaton aka HeTTaR ( hettar@uq.net.au )

   This is a GTK theme which should work with any application that uses
the gtk toolkit. The theme is designed to be clean professional but
visually pleasing. I also attempted to give it a 3d look whilst
maintaining the flat look where things look like they are connect rather 
than piled on top of each other.

   You are free to use this theme yourself. You are free to give this
theme to other people. You are free to include this theme on CD's or
pretty much where ever you want to. All I ask is that this file 
remains in place, you don't claim credit for my work and that you tell 
me about it so that I can feel good ;o).
 
   I hope you enjoy using this theme.
