><P
>      &#8216;Coding style&#8217; refers to the way source code is
      formatted.  For C, this involves things like brace placement,
      indentation, and the way parentheses are used.  GNOME has a mix
      of coding styles, and we do not enforce any one of them.  The
      most important thing is for the code to be consistent within a
      program or library &#8212; code with sloppy formatting is not
      acceptable, since it is hard to read.
    </P
><P
>      When writing a new program or library, please follow a
      consistent style of brace placement and indentation.  If you do
      not have any personal preference for a style, we recommend the
      Linux kernel coding style, or the GNU coding style.
    </P
><P
>      Read the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>(Standards)Writing C</TT
> info node in
      the GNU documentation.  Then, get the Linux kernel sources and
      read the file
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>linux/Documentation/CodingStyle</TT
>, and ignore
      Linus's jokes.  These two documents will give you a good idea of
      what we recommend for GNOME code.

NAME="INDENT"
>Indentation Style</A
></H2
><P
>	For core GNOME code we prefer the Linux kernel indentation
	style.  Use 8-space tabs for indentation.
      </P
><P
>        Using 8-space tabs for indentation provides a number of
	benefits.  It makes the code easier to read, since the
	indentation is clearly marked.  It also helps you keep your
	code honest by forcing you to split functions into more
	modular and well-defined chunks &#8212; if your indentation
	goes too far to the right, then it means your function is
	designed badly and you should split it to make it more modular
	or re-think it.
      </P
><P
>        8-space tabs for indentation also helps you to design
        functions that fit nicely in a single screen, which means that
        people can understand the code without having to scroll back
        and forth in order to understand it.
      </P
><P
>	If you use Emacs, then you can select the Linux kernel
	indentation style by including this in your
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.emacs</TT

	<TABLE

BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"

CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>(add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook
          (lambda ()
            (c-set-style "k&#38;r")
            (setq c-basic-offset 8)))
	</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>

	On newer Emacsen or with a newer cc-mode, you may be able to
	simply do this instead:

	<TABLE

BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"

            (c-set-style "linux")))
	</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>

	If you use vim, then you can select the GNOME kernel
	indentation style by including this fragment in your
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>~/.vimrc</TT
> file:

	<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"

CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>set ts=8
if !exists("autocommands_loaded")
  let autocommands_loaded = 1
  augroup C
      autocmd BufRead *.c set cindent
  augroup END
endif
	</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
      </P
><P
>	The GNU indentation style is the default for Emacs, so you do
	not need to put anything in your <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.emacs</TT
> to
	enable it.  If you wish to select it explicitly, substitute
	&#8220;gnu&#8221; for &#8220;linux&#8221; in the example above.
      </P
><P
>	If you know how to customize indentation styles in other popular

NAME="NAMING"
>Naming Conventions</A
></H2
><P
>	It is important to follow a good naming convention for the
	symbols in your programs.  This is especially important for
	libraries, since they should not pollute the global namespace
	&#8212; it is very annoying when a library has sloppily-named
	symbols that clash with names you may want to use in your
	programs.
      </P
><P
>	Function names should be of the form
	<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>module_submodule_operation</TT
>, for example,
	<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>gnome_canvas_set_scroll_region</TT
> or
	<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>gnome_mime_get_keys</TT
>.  This naming
	convention eliminates inter-module clashes of symbol names.
	This is very important for libraries.
      </P
><P
>	Symbols should have descriptive names.  As Linus says, do not
	use <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cntusr()</TT
>, use
	<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>count_active_users()</TT
> instead.  This makes
	code very easy to read and almost self-documenting.
      </P
><P
>	Try to use the same naming conventions as in GTK+ and the
	GNOME libraries:

	<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>	      Function names are lowercase, with underscores to
	      separate words, like this:
	      <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>gnome_canvas_set_scroll_region()</TT
>,
	      <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>gnome_mime_get_keys()</TT
>.
	    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	      Macros and enumerations are uppercase, with underscores
	      to separate words, like this:
	      <SPAN
CLASS="SYMBOL"
>GNOMEUIINFO_SUBTREE()</SPAN
> for a macro, and
	      <SPAN
CLASS="SYMBOL"
>GNOME_INTERACT_NONE</SPAN
> for an enumeration
	      value.
	    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	      Types and structure names are mixed upper and lowercase,
	      like this:  <SPAN
CLASS="SYMBOL"
>GnomeCanvasItem</SPAN
>,
	      <SPAN
CLASS="SYMBOL"
>GnomeIconList</SPAN
>.
	    </P
></LI
></UL
>

	Using underscores to separate words makes the code less
	cramped and easier to edit, since you can use your editor's
	word commands to navigate quickly.
      </P
><P
>	If you are writing a library, then you may need to have
	exported symbols that are to be used only within the library.
	For example, two of the object files that compose the library
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>libfoo.so</TT
> may need to access symbols from
	each other, but this symbols are not meant to be used from
	user programs.  In that case, put an underscore before the
	function name and make the first words follow the standard
	module/submodule convention.  For example, you could have a
	function called
	<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>_foo_internal_frobnicate()</TT
>.

>	  It is important that your variables be consistently named.
	  For example, a module that does a list manipulation may
	  choose to name the variables that hold a list pointer
	  &#8220;<SPAN
CLASS="SYMBOL"
>l</SPAN
>&#8221;, for terseness and
	  simplicity.  However, it is important that a module that
	  manipulates widgets and sizes does not use variables called
	  &#8220;<SPAN
CLASS="SYMBOL"
>w</SPAN
>&#8221; for both widgets and widths
	  (as in width/height values); this would make the code
	  inconsistent and harder to read.
	</P
><P
>	  Of course, these very short and terse names should only be
	  used for the local variables of functions.  Never call a
	  global variable &#8220;<SPAN
CLASS="SYMBOL"
>x</SPAN
>&#8221;; use a
	  longer name that tells what it does.

	This has the advantage that you can use shorter names for
	internal functions within a single source file, since they are
	not globally visible and thus you do not need the
	module/submodule prefix.
      </P
><P
>	Learn the correct use of the <SPAN
CLASS="SYMBOL"
>const</SPAN

	Use it consistently, as it can make the compiler catch a lot
	of stupid bugs for you.
      </P
><P
>        If you have a function that returns a pointer to internal data
        which the user is not supposed to free, you should use a const
        modifier.  This will warn the user if he tries to do something
        incorrect, for example:

	<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>const char *gnome_mime_get_info (const char *info);
	</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>

	The compiler will warn the user if he tries to free the
	returned string.  This can catch a lot of bugs.
      </P
><P
>	If you have random &#8216;magic values&#8217; in your program
	or library, use macros to define them instead of hardcoding
	them where they are used:

	<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>/* Amount of padding for GUI elements */
#define GNOME_PAD          8
#define GNOME_PAD_SMALL    4
#define GNOME_PAD_BIG      12
	</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
      </P
><P
>	If you have a list of possible values for a variable, do not
	use macros for them; use an enum instead and give it a type
	name &#8212; this lets you have symbolic names for those
	values in a debugger.  Also, do not use an &#8216;int&#8217;
	to store an enumeration value; use the enum type instead.
	This lets the compiler catch errors for you, allows the
	debugger to show proper values for these values and makes it
	obvious what values a variable can take.  An example follows:

	<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>/* Shadow types */
typedef enum {
	GTK_SHADOW_NONE,
	GTK_SHADOW_IN,
	GTK_SHADOW_OUT,
	GTK_SHADOW_ETCHED_IN,
	GTK_SHADOW_ETCHED_OUT
} GtkShadowType;

void gtk_frame_set_shadow_type (GtkFrame *frame, GtkShadowType type);
	</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
      </P
><P
>	If you define a set of values for a bit field, do it like
	this:

	<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>/* Update flags for items */
enum {
	GNOME_CANVAS_UPDATE_REQUESTED  = 1 &#60;&#60; 0,
	GNOME_CANVAS_UPDATE_AFFINE     = 1 &#60;&#60; 1,
	GNOME_CANVAS_UPDATE_CLIP       = 1 &#60;&#60; 2,
	GNOME_CANVAS_UPDATE_VISIBILITY = 1 &#60;&#60; 3,
	GNOME_CANVAS_UPDATE_IS_VISIBLE = 1 &#60;&#60; 4
};
	</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>

	This makes it easier to modify the list of values, and is less
	error-prone than specifying the values by hand.  It also lets
	you use those values as symbols in a debugger.
      </P
><P
>	Do not write obfuscated code, but also try to be spartan.  Do
	not use more parentheses than are necessary to clarify an
	expression.  Use spaces before parentheses and after commas,
	and also around binary operators.
      </P
><P
>	Please do not put hacks in the code.  Instead of writing an
	ugly hack, re-work the code so that it is clean, extensible
	and maintainable.
      </P
><P
>	Make sure your code compiles with absolutely no warnings from
	the compiler.  These help you catch stupid bugs.  Use function
	prototypes in header files consistently.
      </P
><P
>        Within GNOME you can use the
        <SPAN
CLASS="SYMBOL"
>GNOME_COMPILE_WARNINGS</SPAN
> Autoconf macro in your
        <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>configure.in</TT
>.  This will take care of
        turning on a good set of compiler warnings in a portable
        fashion.
      </P
><P
>	Comment your code.  Please put a comment before each function
	that says what it does.  Do not say how it does it unless it
	is absolutely necessary; this should be obvious from reading
	the code.  If it is not, you may want to rework it until the
	code is easy to understand.
