Darrius: I see your ships off my coast...
Darrius: For fear of invasion...I ask for a peace treaty...
Simon: I see yours. 
Darrius: And you see mine going to islands south of me that I am settling...
Simon: I do not intend invading mainland China, but I don't want a peace treaty
Darrius: I suspect an invasion...I want a peace treaty to settle my fears.
Darrius: Please sign the treaty...
Simon: My boat is carrying a diplomat in order to establish an embassy
Simon: I don't have the techs to be able to mount a successful invasion
Darrius: How do I know you won't steal my knowledge?
Darrius: I want a peace treaty
Simon: What happens if I refuse? (let me guess - my caravels get it....)
Darrius: I am not here to threaten...I am trying to reason with you.
Darrius: What do we have to lose with a treaty?
Darrius: Please accept the treaty
Simon: I've offloaded my diploat and explorer so you should now be able to see that my boats have no units on them and I haven't stolen your tech
Darrius: I see this...
Darrius: ...but why not have peace?
Simon: This is complicated - I have a long standing war with the Chinese which arose due to some rather unethical actions of the previous Chinese ruler
Simon: I'll have to check with my allies about a peace treaty
Darrius: Well, he is gone now...
Simon: I think we'll have to sort this out when we carry on the game on Wednesday. But I can assure you I do behave honourably and stick to my agreements etc.
Darrius: I want to believe you...
Simon: If I offered you one now I'd be breaking the spirit of certain previous agreements I've made with my allies, so I'd need to get some agreement with them
Darrius: Alright
