Welcome the Xml Examples....

Since there are many example folders here, we have included only 
the .cs files for all the projects except the MSXML example and the Serialization examples.

In the examples where we have only included the .cs files, there will be the following
difference between the code in the .cs file and the code in the chapter:

To find or write to an XML data file, we only have to go back one directory to the Xml directory,
thus you will find "..\\books.xml" in the .cs files rather than "..\\..\\..\\books.xml", as
you would use to go from the bin\debug directory from a VS.NET project back to the
Xml directory.

Also, the ADO examples use the same Login.cs construction of chapters 9 and 10. 
There is a make.bat file in each ADOSample... directory that will compile the example,
and the connection string is changed in the file Login.cs in this directory.
