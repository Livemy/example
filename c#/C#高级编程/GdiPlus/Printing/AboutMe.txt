Dr. Simon Robinson graduated with a PHD in theoretical
physics in 1992. He then spent a couple of years working
as a physics researcher, mostly doing mathematical modelling
of certain types of superconductor, before he realised there
was more money in doing straight computer programming!

He worked for a period at Lucent Technologies, doing a mixture
of programming and research into new technologies, before
taking up a career in full time writing/freelance development.

His main specialist areas include COM and COM+, data access,
directories, DirectX and web development, and he has authored
and coauthored a number of books for Wrox Press.

Simon lives in Lancaster, UK, where he shares a house
with some students. His outside interests include
theatre and street dance. He has also maintained an interest
in science, and does some research in computational fluid
mechanics for Lancaster University.
